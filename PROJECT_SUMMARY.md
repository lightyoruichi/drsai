## Data Flow

```
1. User uploads scan + initial diagnosis
   ↓
2. Data stored in sessionStorage (temporary)
   ↓
3. POST to /api/analyze
   ↓
4. Server sends to OpenRouter API
   - Image as base64
   - Structured JSON prompt
   ↓
5. Claude 3.5 Sonnet analyzes
   ↓
6. Returns structured JSON:
   - Overall assessment
   - Confidence score
   - Findings array
   - Comparison with initial diagnosis
   - 32-tooth chart data
   - Recommendations
   - Urgency level
   ↓
7. Results stored in sessionStorage
   ↓
8. Display on brief results page
   ↓
9. Full results page with interactive chart
```

## API Response Structure

```typescript
interface DentalDiagnosis {
  overallAssessment: string;
  confidenceScore: number;
  findings: Array<{
    category: string;
    description: string;
    severity: 'none' | 'mild' | 'moderate' | 'severe';
    confidence: number;
  }>;
  comparisonWithInitialDiagnosis: {
    correct: string[];
    incorrect: string[];
    additional: string[];
  };
  teethChart: Array<{
    toothNumber: number;        // 1-32
    condition: string;          // e.g., "Healthy", "Cavity", "Crown"
    severity: 'none' | 'mild' | 'moderate' | 'severe';
    notes: string;
  }>;
  recommendations: string[];
  urgency: 'routine' | 'soon' | 'urgent' | 'emergency';
}
```

## Next Steps to Run

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Create `.env` file:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. **Add your OpenRouter API key to `.env`:**
   ```env
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-your-actual-key-here
   ```

4. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Visit:** http://localhost:4321

## Testing the App

You can test with any image initially. For realistic testing:
- Use dental X-ray images
- Try panoramic dental scans
- Upload intraoral photos
- Test with PDF dental reports

Example initial diagnosis to enter:
```
I notice some discoloration on my upper right molar (#3), 
and I've been experiencing sensitivity to cold drinks. 
My gums seem slightly swollen on the lower left side.
```

## Production Considerations

### Before Deploying:

1. **Set up persistent storage** - Currently uses sessionStorage (demo only)
   - Add database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
   - Store analysis results permanently
   - Associate with unique IDs

2. **Add authentication** (optional)
   - User accounts
   - Private vs public links
   - Usage limits

3. **Rate limiting**
   - Prevent API abuse
   - Track usage per IP/user

4. **File size limits**
   - Currently allows up to 10MB
   - Add server-side validation

5. **Cost monitoring**
   - Track OpenRouter API usage
   - Set spending limits
   - Add usage alerts

### Deployment Options:

- Vercel (recommended - easy SSR support)
- Netlify
- Railway
- Fly.io
- Any Node.js hosting

## Cost Estimate

**Per Analysis:**
- OpenRouter API: ~$0.05 - $0.15
- (Claude 3.5 Sonnet with vision)

**For 1000 analyses:**
- ~$50 - $150

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] PDF report generation
- [ ] User accounts and history
- [ ] Multiple AI model support
- [ ] Batch analysis for multiple scans
- [ ] Export to dental software formats
- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] Mobile app version
- [ ] Integration with dental practice software
- [ ] Comparison with previous scans
- [ ] Treatment plan suggestions
